## ðŸ§¬ JupyterHub Bioimage Environment

A **JupyterHub-based Docker image** with a pre-configured **Python environment**, including a wide range of tools for bioimage analysis such as:

- [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/)
- [Cellpose](https://www.cellpose.org/)
- [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/)
- [Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/)
- [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/)

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

This repository outlines the Docker image configuration and Jupyter proxy integration used to support image analysis tools.

Currently, the image is based on the **University of MÃ¼nster JupyterHub image**. However, we are planning to build a separate, standalone image to ensure accessibility and compatibility with various JupyterHub instances.

To build the image yourself, you can start with either:

- A standard Linux base image (e.g., `ubuntu`, `debian`)
- A JupyterHub notebook base image (e.g., from [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

Make sure to install the necessary components, including:

- `noVNC`
- `X11`
- Other required dependencies for your image analysis tools

This setup enables support for **GUI-based applications** within the Jupyter notebook interface.
